## Decorators

- functions that apply logic
- they can be applied to classes, methods,properties and parameters

## Controllers

- no-spec = no test file
- --dry-run = simulates the generation of the controller

## Services

- Services are providers. The main idea of a provider is that it can inject "dependencies"
